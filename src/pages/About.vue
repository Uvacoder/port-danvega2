      <p>
        I am a Software Engineer living just outside of one of my favorite
        places in the world, Cleveland, Ohio. I am a self-taught programmer who
        firmly believes that you can accomplish anything in this life if you put
        your mind to it, roll up your sleeves and are willing to put in the
        work.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been writing software for over 20+ years now and I use my
        knowledge, passion, and influence to help other developers achieve their
        goals. I teach online and currently, have over 100,000 students.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my personal life I am a husband to my best friend in the world and a
        father of two little girls. I enjoy reading, running and lifting weights
        to get me through the week.

      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p>
        My journey to becoming a computer programmer did not start out at a
        fancy university. I like to give my mom some credit for making me take a
        typing class in high school that I excelled in, which sparked my
        interest in computers, thanks, mom! After high school, I was working as
        a landscaper and one day I just decided that this was not the life for
        me. I decided to enroll at a local college for a programming
        certification in Applied Computer Sciences. Once I completed this
        certification, I did some freelancing to hone my skills, and soon after
        I landed my first job at a startup in San Francisco! It was difficult
        leaving my friends and family, but I was so excited for this opportunity
        and quickly packed my bags for the west coast.
      </p>
      <p>
        My educational journey did not stop there. I like to consider myself a
        lifelong learner. I believe having a passion for learning really is the
        secret to success in life. While I was living in California, I hired a
        teaching assistant from UC Berkeley to tutor me in computer programming.
        I spent most of my nights far from home immersing myself in Java
        programming books to advance my skills, and it certainly paid off!
      </p>
      <p>
        After two years in San Francisco, I landed a new position back in
        Cleveland and jumped at the opportunity to move back home. I continued
        to advance to different positions and companies over the years and here
        I am, 20+ years later, still loving to code every single day.
      </p>

      <h2>One thing that has always stuck with me</h2>
      <p>
        One thing that has always stuck with me over the years is how grateful I
        am for all of the people who taught and inspired me over the years. This
        help inspired me to always share my passion for learning with others.
        When I discovered online teaching, I knew this was my calling to help
        other people make positive changes in their lives through education. As
        I said in the beginning, I believe if you are willing to put in the
        work, you can accomplish anything in this life. If programming is what
        you are hoping to learn and work hard on, I am happy to show you the
        way!
      </p>

      <h2>Some other facts about me</h2>
      <p>
        I live just outside of Cleveland, Ohio with my amazing wife, Jen, our
        daughter Isabella. When I am not spending time with my family, I have a
        number of things that keep me busy. I love to read books, listen to
        podcasts and watch online courses. I have a real thirst for knowledge
        and it consumes me every single day of the week. I also love to run &
        lift heavy weights, which keep me balanced throughout the week.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also the president of a nonprofit here in Northeast Ohio called CLE
        Cares. Our mission is to try and help as many people as we can in the
        area and give back to a place that we hold near and dear to our hearts.
        I also love to speak at user group meetings and conferences around the
        country. If you are interested in having me speak at your event, please
        contact me.
