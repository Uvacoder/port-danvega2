This is the personal blog of Dan Vega. I'm a programmer, curriculum developer and life long learner from Cleveland Ohio.

I created this site so that I could document the things that I learn or enjoy working with and help you avoid the mistakes that I make. If you enjoy my content please share it with your friends.
